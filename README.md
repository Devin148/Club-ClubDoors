Club - ClubDoors
==============

ClubDoors was the second Java application in the "Club series" following ClubLogin.

ClubDoors is an entrance fee ticketing system, allowing a user located at a remote terminal to charge customers, log their entry, and print a basic receipt. Then, at a later day, it gives users the power to run and print reports on the saved guest information.

ClubDoors was developed in early 2010, after a major breakthrough in my understanding of Java (thanks to Northeastern). I have made tremendous improvements since then. I would recommend looking at my contributions to Autopsy (https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy) for a more up-to-date representation of my code.
